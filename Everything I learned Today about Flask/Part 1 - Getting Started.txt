I learned how to use Flask to build a Full-Featured Web Application.

> What is Flask?
  Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python.
  It provides developers with the necessary tools and libraries to build web applications and APIs quickly and easily.
  Flask is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a minimalistic core that can be extended as needed with various
  third-party extensions.

> Some features and benefits of Flask include:

1. Built-in development server and debugger
2. Built-in support for handling requests and responses using HTTP methods
3. Integrated support for unit testing
4. Support for Jinja2 templating engine
5. Support for SQLite, MySQL, and PostgresSQL databases, among others
6. Flexible URL routing
7. A wide range of third-party extensions to add additional functionality to your application.

     "Overall, Flask is a popular choice among developers due to its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use.
              It's a great choice for building web applications and APIs of any size or complexity"
