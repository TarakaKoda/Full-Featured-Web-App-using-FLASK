                                             PART-1: GETTING STARTED

-> What is Flask?
   Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for Python.
   It provides developers with the necessary tools and libraries to build web applications and APIs quickly and easily.
   Flask is designed to be simple and easy to use, with a minimalistic core that can be extended as needed with various
   third-party extensions.


-> Some features and benefits of Flask include:

1. Built-in development server and debugger
2. Built-in support for handling requests and responses using HTTP methods
3. Integrated support for unit testing
4. Support for Jinja2 templating engine
5. Support for SQLite, MySQL, and PostgresSQL databases, among others
6. Flexible URL routing
7. A wide range of third-party extensions to add additional functionality to your application.

     "Overall, Flask is a popular choice among developers due to its simplicity, flexibility, and ease of use.
              It's a great choice for building web applications and APIs of any size or complexity"

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> What is a Web Server?
 - A web server is a software application that processes requests sent by clients over the internet, and returns
   responses accordingly. When a client requests a resource, such as a web page or a file, the web server receives
   the request, processes it, and returns the appropriate response.


-> What are Python-Based Web Applications or Frameworks?
 - Python-based web applications or frameworks are software programs that use the Python programming language to
   build web applications. They provide a way to handle HTTP requests and responses, manage user sessions,
   generate dynamic content, interact with databases, and perform other web-related tasks.

   Python has many popular web frameworks, including Flask, Django, Pyramid, Bottle, and CherryPy, to name a few.
   These frameworks provide a set of tools and libraries that make it easier to build web applications quickly and
   efficiently. They handle many of the low-level details of web development, such as routing, authentication, and
   templating, so that developers can focus on writing application-specific code.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> What is WSGI Application?
 - WSGI stands for Web Server Gateway Interface, and it is a standard interface between web servers and
   Python-based web applications or frameworks. The purpose of WSGI is to provide a standard interface that allows
   web servers to communicate with web applications or frameworks in a consistent and efficient manner.

   A WSGI application is a Python callable that conforms to the WSGI specification. When a web server receives a request
   from a client, it passes the request to the WSGI application, which generates a response that is returned to
   the server and ultimately sent back to the client.

   Flask is a Python-based web framework that provides a simple and flexible way to create web applications.
   By creating an instance of the Flask class, we are creating a WSGI application that can receive requests from
   a web server and generate responses that are sent back to the client.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> What is a route decorator?
 - @app.route("/")   "/" is the root page of the website
   In Flask, a route decorator is a special function that is used to associate a URL with a function that generates a
   response. A route decorator is typically used to define the URL pattern for a particular view function, and it tells
   Flask which URL should trigger that function.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> What is a URL?
 - A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is a web address that identifies a unique location on the internet.
   A URL consists of several parts, including:
   Scheme: the protocol used to access the resource (such as http or https)
   Domain name: the name of the server that hosts the resource (such as www.example.com)
   Path: the location of the resource on the server (such as /blog)
   Query string: optional parameters that can be passed to the server to modify the behavior of the resource (such as ?page=2)

   For example, the URL https://www.example.com/blog?page=2 consists of the scheme https, the domain name www.example.com,
   the path /blog, and the query string ?page=2.
   When a user enters this URL into their web browser, the browser sends a request to the server at www.example.com
   asking for the resource located at /blog?page=2. The server then responds with the resource (in this case, a blog page),
   which is displayed in the user's web browser.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-> What is if __name__ == "__main__"?
 - The if __name__ == "__main__" statement allows a script to distinguish between being run as the main program and being
   imported as a module. Typically, any code that is intended to be run only when the script is executed as the main program
   (and not when it is imported as a module) is placed inside this conditional block.

                                                                                                             18-04-2023
                                             PART-2: TEMPLATES
                                                                                                             02:00:19PM

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> What are Templates in flask?
- In Flask, a template is a file that contains HTML code with placeholders for dynamic content that will be generated by
  the application at runtime. Flask uses the Jinja2 template engine to render these templates and generate the HTML that
  will be sent to the client's browser.

  Templates allow developers to separate the presentation logic from the business logic of the application, making it
  easier to maintain and modify the code. Flask templates typically have the file extension ".html" and can be located
  in a subdirectory called "templates" within the Flask application's main directory.

  To render a template in Flask, the application typically creates a context containing the dynamic data to be displayed,
  and then passes this context to the Jinja2 engine to generate the final HTML output. This process is handled automatically
  by Flask's built-in template rendering functions, such as render_template(), which takes the name of the template file
  as an argument, along with any additional variables needed to render the template.

  Overall, templates in Flask are a powerful tool for building dynamic and interactive web applications, allowing
  developers to create highly customizable user interfaces that can adapt to changing data and user input.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> What is rander_template()?
- render_template() is a function provided by the Flask web framework that is used to render Jinja2 templates in a
  Flask application. This function takes the name of the template file as its first argument, along with any additional
  arguments containing dynamic data that should be passed to the template for rendering.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> What are Static HTML Pages?
- Static HTML pages are web pages that are delivered to the user exactly as they are stored on the server, without any
  server-side processing or dynamic content generation. In other words, the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code of the page is
  fixed and does not change based on user input or other external factors.

  Static HTML pages can be created using a variety of tools, including text editors, integrated development environments
  (IDEs), and website builders. Once the HTML code for a page has been written, it can be saved to a file with a .html
  extension and uploaded to a web server for delivery to users.

  Static HTML pages are often used for simple websites or web applications that do not require dynamic content or user
  interaction. They can be fast and efficient to deliver, as there is no need for server-side processing or database
  access. However, they can be difficult to maintain and update, as any changes to the content or layout of the page
  must be made manually by editing the HTML code directly.

  Overall, static HTML pages can be a useful tool for creating simple web pages or prototypes, but for more complex
  web applications with dynamic content and user interaction, a server-side programming language such as Python with a
  web framework like Flask or Django is typically required.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> What is Jinja2?
- Jinja2 is a popular and widely-used templating engine for Python, which is integrated with the Flask web framework to
  provide dynamic HTML rendering for web applications. It was created as a successor to the earlier Jinja templating
  engine, and is known for its flexibility, ease of use, and powerful features.

  Jinja2 allows Flask developers to create HTML templates with placeholders for dynamic data, which can be populated
  with content generated by the application at runtime. This separation of presentation and application logic makes it
  easier to develop and maintain web applications, as it allows developers to focus on the core logic of the application
  while leaving the presentation layer to the templating engine.

  Jinja2 supports a wide range of features, including template inheritance, macros, filters, and loops, which can be
  used to create complex and dynamic templates with ease. It also provides a secure template system, which protects
  against common security threats such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

  Overall, Jinja2 is an essential component of the Flask framework, and is widely regarded as one of the most powerful
  and flexible templating engines available for Python developers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> What control structures does Jinja2 provide for creating dynamic HTML pages in Flask?
- Jinja2 is a powerful templating engine used in Flask to create dynamic HTML pages. It provides a variety of
  control structures, including looping, if and else conditions, which allow developers to create complex and dynamic
  templates with ease.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> What is Looping in Jinja2?
- Jinja2 provides a range of looping constructs, including the for loop and the loop.index variable, which allow
  developers to iterate over collections of data and generate HTML code dynamically.
  Here is an example of a simple for loop in Jinja2:
    {% for item in items %}
    <li>{{ item }}</li>
  {% endfor %}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> What is If and else conditions in Jinja2?
  Jinja2 also provides a range of conditional constructs, including the if statement, else statement, and elif statement.
  These allow developers to conditionally render HTML code based on the values of variables or the results of other
  logical expressions.
  Here is an example of a simple if statement in Jinja2:
      {% if user %}
    <p>Hello, {{ user }}!</p>
  {% else %}
    <p>Hello, guest!</p>
  {% endif %}

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> what is a block in jinja2?
  In Jinja2, a block is a section of a template that can be overridden or extended by child templates. It is defined
  using the {% block %} tag in the parent template, and child templates can override the content of the block using the
  same tag.

  Here's an example of a parent template that defines a block:
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
      <title>{% block title %}Default Title{% endblock %}</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div id="content">
        {% block content %}
          <p>This is the default content.</p>
        {% endblock %}
      </div>
    </body>
    </html>

  In this example, the parent template defines two blocks: title and content. The content within each block is wrapped
  in {% block %} and {% endblock %} tags.
  A child template can override the content of a block by defining the same block with the same name in its own
  {% block %} tag.
  For example:
    {% extends "base.html" %}
    {% block title %}My Custom Title{% endblock %}
    {% block content %}
      <h1>Welcome to my site!</h1>
      <p>This is my custom content.</p>
    {% endblock %}

  In this example, the child template extends the parent template using the {% extends %} tag. It then overrides the
  title block and the content block with its own content.
  Overall, blocks in Jinja2 are a powerful feature that allows developers to create modular and reusable templates, and
  to define a common structure for a set of related pages while still allowing individual pages to customize their
  content as needed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> What is url_for?
  url_for is a function in the Flask web application framework for generating URLs to endpoints (view functions) within
  the application. It takes the name of the endpoint as the first argument and any number of keyword arguments that
  correspond to the variable parts of the URL rule for that endpoint.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

************************************************************************************************************************
                                                                                                             19-04-2023
                                       PART-2: FORMS AND VALIDATIONS
                                                                                                             10:35:30AM

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> what are forms in flask?
  In Flask, a "Form" is a way to represent the data submitted by the user via an HTML form. It is a collection of fields
  that the user fills out and submits to the server for processing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> What is wtf extension?
  In order to work with forms in Flask, you typically use the Flask-WTF extension, which provides a simple way to define
  and validate forms. This extension includes functionality for generating HTML forms, validating user input, and
  handling form submission.

  To use Flask-WTF, you first need to install it using pip. You can then define a form by creating a class that inherits
  from the FlaskForm class provided by Flask-WTF. Inside the class, you can define the fields of the form using various
  field classes such as StringField, IntegerField, BooleanField, etc.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Why we need to put a secret key?
  In Flask, the secret_key is used for securely signing session cookies and other security-related uses. The secret key
  is a random string of bytes used to encrypt the session cookie data and protect it from tampering.

  When a Flask application is created, it should have a secret key set, which is used to sign cookies and other data
  that needs to be protected from tampering. Without a secret key, the data can be easily manipulated by attackers,
  potentially causing security vulnerabilities in your application.

  By setting a secret key, Flask can securely store session data, including the user's login credentials and other
  sensitive information. This helps to prevent unauthorized access and improve the overall security of your application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> What is flash message in flask?
  In Flask, you can use the flash function to display messages to the user. The flash function stores a message in a
  cookie that will be sent to the browser, and then automatically deleted on the next request.
